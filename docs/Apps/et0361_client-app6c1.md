## Notes:  
  
This form, LoginForm1, is the simplest React / Formik app you will find.  But it has no style. 
It uses the "Function Component" code pattern, that Formik likes and is pretty easy to create.  

In the file, App.js, you can comment out the first form, to see the form, LoginForm2.

Below is is the "Class Component" code pattern that uses React's Form validation module.  It 
also uses AdminLTE's (actually Bootstrap's) Classnames to render a nice looking styled form.
