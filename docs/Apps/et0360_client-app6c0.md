# Client App6c0   (360)

## Notes:  
  
The simplest client side App.js ever, just saying "Hello Bruce". React and Formik are loaded in 
./client/node_modules (see [package.json](Apps/et0302_client-apps.md) ) and AdminLTE is 
installed in ./public/dist.  They are available for use, but they are not.  

There are also no included scripts, i.e. imported modules and there are no subfolders 
in the src folder, i.e. no src/components or src/services.
