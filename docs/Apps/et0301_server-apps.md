# FormR Server Apps

  These apps were our first attempt to find examples of an Express app template.
  We found the BezCoder tutorials to have the right mix of clarity and simplicity
  that installed easily and worked without any glitches.

  He divided his app scripts into client and server folders each having their own set
  of intalled node modules.  Click [here](Apps/et0308_BezKoder-apps.md) is an description of his tutorials
