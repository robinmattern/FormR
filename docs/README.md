# The FormR Project

- FormR is an easy to use application that uses a Sequelize, ExpressJS, React-Admin and NodeJS (SERN) stack. The coding philosophy leans more towards DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) than WET (Write Every Time).

- A NodeJS ExpressJS server is used to receive API calls that use Sequelize to perform database tasks using any database server.  

- A React-Admin client is used to provide authentication of  users and standard create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functions for any database table. JWT and Axios are used for authentication. AdminLTE is used for the user interface (UI) and Formik and YUP for data entry forms.

- The FormR coding philosophy emphasizes vars over consts/lets and functions over classes.
